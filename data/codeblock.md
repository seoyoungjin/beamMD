Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
 ```python
 s = "Python syntax highlighting"
 print s
 ```
  
  ```
  No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
  But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
  ```
